## Usage

To use the Azle Task Management System, you need to have an Azle (DFINITY) account. Here's how to get started:

- **Initial Tasks:** To load the initial batch of tasks, use the `getInitialTasks` query function. This function retrieves the first tasks for you to work with.
- **Loading More Tasks:** As you scroll through your task list, you can use the `loadMoreTasks` query function to fetch additional tasks in a paginated manner.
- **Task Details:** To access the details of a specific task, use the `getTask(id)` query function, providing the task's unique ID.
- **Filter by Tags:** You can filter tasks by tags using the `getTaskByTags(tag)` query function. It returns all tasks with the specified tag.
- **Search for Tasks:** The `searchTasks(searchInput)` query function allows you to search for tasks based on keywords found in their titles or descriptions.
- **Task Completion:** When a task is completed, use the `completedTask(id)` update function to mark it as completed.
- **Adding Tasks:** Organizations or groups can add tasks using the `addTask(payload)` update function. Provide the task's details in the payload.
- **Adding Tags:** For task creators, use the `addTags(id, tags)` update function to add tags to a task.
- **Task Modification:** The `updateTask(id, payload)` update function allows task creators to modify task details.
- **Task Deletion:** To delete a task, use the `deleteTask(id)` update function, but note that only the task's creator can delete it.

## Installation

You can run your Azle Task Management System in your Azle environment or a development environment.

1. **Environment Setup:** Ensure you have an Azle environment set up and running.
2. **Deployment:** Deploy the Task Management System canister to your Azle environment.
3. **Configuration:** Update your system configurations as needed.
4. **Use the System:** Access the system via a web browser and start managing your tasks.


## Run Locally

`dfx` is the tool you will use to interact with the IC locally and on mainnet. If you don't already have it installed:

```bash
npm run dfx_install
```

Next you will want to start a replica, which is a local instance of the IC that you can deploy your canisters to:

```bash
dfx start --background
```

If you ever want to stop the replica:

```bash
dfx stop
```

Now you can deploy your canister locally:

```bash
npm install
dfx deploy
```
